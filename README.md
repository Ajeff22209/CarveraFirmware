This repository manages binary releases of [CarveraFirmware](https://www.makera.com). 

Checkout the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MakeraInc/CarveraFirmware/releases) for downloads.

To let the Carvera work perfectly, please make sure both your controller software and firmware are up to date. For firmware, download the new firmware first, then use the 'update' function to upgrade the firmware, and reset the machine after the update is complete.

Please refer to the current version of the firmware source here:
https://github.com/MakeraInc/CarveraFirmware README.md 
Will move the repository here when we finish improving several functions recently.
